                <p>
                    The <i>Spinosaurus</i> is a genus of big carnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in the Late Cretaceous, 
                    about 112 to 93 million years ago, in what is now the North Africa. <br>
                    The most recent study suggests that they could have reached 14-18 meters in length, 
                    and 5-6 meters in height. 
                    Spinosaurus is estimated to have weighed between 6,400 and 8,000 kilograms but could reach 20,000kg. <br>
                    Spinosaurus is known to have eaten fish, aquatic prey and small to medium terrestrial prey as well. 
                    Evidence suggests that it was semiaquatic

            </div>
            <h3>Spinosaurus aegyptiacus</h3>
            <p>
                Spinosaurus aegyptiacus is the most well-known and iconic species of the Spinosaurus genus. 
                It was first described in 1915 by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer, 
                based on fossils discovered in the Bahariya Oasis of western Egypt. 
                These original fossils included parts of the skull, vertebrae, and limbs, but unfortunately, 
                they were destroyed during World War II in a bombing raid on the museum in Munich. 
                Since then, additional fossils and discoveries from Morocco and Egypt have helped scientists better understand the creature.
            </p>
            <h3>Spinosaurus maroccanus</h3>
            <p>
                Spinosaurus maroccanus is a more controversial and lesser-known species within the Spinosauridae group. 
                It was named in 1996 by paleontologist Dale Russell, based on vertebrae and fragmentary remains found in the Kem Kem Beds 
                of southeastern Morocco, a region famous for its rich Cretaceous fossil deposits.<br>
                The fossils attributed to S. maroccanus showed some differences in vertebral structure compared 
                to S. aegyptiacus, particularly in the size and shape of the cervical (neck) vertebrae. 
                Russell proposed that these differences were enough to distinguish a new species. 
                However, many paleontologists remain skeptical and consider Spinosaurus maroccanus to be either a junior synonym of 
                Spinosaurus aegyptiacus or simply too fragmentary to confirm as a separate species.

                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>
                Spinosaurus was a highly distinctive and specialized theropod dinosaur with unique anatomical features adapted for a semi-aquatic lifestyle. 
                Its skull was long and narrow, measuring about 1.6 meters, and resembled that of a modern crocodile. 
                The snout housed straight, conical teeth without serrations—ideal for catching slippery prey like fish.<br><br>
                he hands were relatively long compared to those of other spinosaurids, and the claws were only slightly curved, suggesting an adaptation for grasping rather than slashing.<br><br>
                One of the most striking features of Spinosaurus was its elongated neural spines, 
                which extended from its back vertebrae. 
                These spines were over 10 times the diameter of the vertebral centra, 
                forming a prominent sail—or possibly a hump-like structure. 
                The shape and structure of the spines suggest they may have been tightly covered by skin 
                rather than supported by a richly vascularized structure, much like the crest of a chameleon.<br><br>
                Notably, it was one of the few theropods where the fourth toe made contact with the ground. 
                Its toe bones were unusually long and strong, ending in broad, flat-bottomed claws, 
                features likely adapted for walking on soft, muddy ground or for aiding in swimming.<br>
                Altogether, these body features point to a dinosaur that was not just a land-based predator but one that spent much of 
                its time in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, hunting fish and moving comfortably both in water and on land.
            </p>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                Spinosaurus displayed a range of unique behaviors that set it apart from other large theropods. 
                Its most iconic feature—the large sail or hump on its back—has puzzled scientists for decades. 
                While its exact purpose remains uncertain, several possible functions have been proposed. 
                The sail may have been used for display, to intimidate rivals, or attract mates by making 
                the dinosaur appear larger and more imposing. It could also have played a role in thermoregulation, 
                either absorbing heat during cooler times of the day or helping dissipate excess body heat in the warm, 
                tropical climate of Cretaceous North Africa. By angling its sail toward or away from the sun or wind, 
                Spinosaurus may have effectively controlled its body temperature.<br><br>
                One of Spinosaurus’s most debated behaviors revolves around its semi-aquatic lifestyle. 
                Its long, crocodile-like jaws, conical teeth, and elevated nostrils suggest it was well-adapted to catching fish. 
                Initially, some paleontologists believed that Spinosaurus hunted mainly in shallow water or from the shore. 
                However, more recent studies of its keeled tail have provided strong evidence that it could actively swim, 
                using its tail like a paddle to propel itself through water—much like a modern crocodile or alligator. 
                This points to a lifestyle where Spinosaurus likely spent a significant amount of time in rivers and wetlands, ambushing aquatic prey.<br><br>
                In terms of sensory abilities, Spinosaurus probably had good vision, 
                though not as highly developed for depth perception as predators like Tyrannosaurus rex. 
                It was capable of short bursts of speed up to 28 km/h, but likely moved more slowly in water and on land most of the time.<br><br>
                Socially, Spinosaurus is believed to have been a solitary animal. 
                There’s no evidence of group nesting or coordinated behavior. 
                It likely came together with others only during mating seasons, much like many modern reptiles.

                <h2>Classification</h2>
            </div>
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
                The Spinosaurus are carnivorous theropods from the Saurischia group and the  family Spinosauridae, which includes two subfamilies: Baryonychinae and Spinosaurinae. 
                The Spinosaurus is in the Spinosaurinae sub-family. <br>
                The spinosaurines share unserrated straight teeth that are widely spaced, 
                as opposed to the baryonychines, which have serrated curved teeth that are numerous.
