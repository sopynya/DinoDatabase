                <h1>Triceratops</h1>
                <p>
                    <i>Triceratops</i> were herbivorous, quadrupedal dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous period that lived about 66-68 million years ago in western North America. 
                    The name Triceratops means 'three-horned face', which refers to the three horns the dinosaur has. 
                    One horn near their beak and two on top of their head. 
                    They also had a large crown-looking frill behind the head. <br>
                    They are very large animals measuring around 8-9 meters in length and 3 meters in height. 
                    A grown Triceratops can weight between 5.000 kg and 9.000 kg.

                <h2>Species</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>The species concept</h3>
            <p>
                The first fossil of a Triceratops was discovered in 1887 in Denver, 
                Colorado, consisting of a pair of horns attached to a skull fragment. 
                At first, paleontologists believed the remains belonged to a prehistoric bison. 
                However, by 1888, it became clear that the fossil was from a dinosaur, and in 1889, 
                the name Triceratops—meaning “three-horned face”—was officially given following the 
                discovery of additional specimens. <br> <br>
                Over time, paleontologists unearthed a wide variety of Triceratops fossils that showed subtle differences from one another. 
                To make sense of these variations, researchers initially divided the specimens into two main groups. 
                The first group included Triceratops horridus, Triceratops prorsus, and Triceratops brevicornus (“the short-horned”), 
                which were characterized by larger skulls and smaller nasal horns. 
                The second group consisted of Triceratops elatus and Triceratops calicornis, 
                which had large brow horns and smaller nasal horns.<br>
                Additional species such as Triceratops serratus and Triceratops flabellatus were also named, 
                though they didn’t fit clearly into either group. Later, three more species were proposed: 
                Triceratops obtusus and Triceratops hatcheri, both with very small nasal horns, 
                and Triceratops eurycephalus, known for a particularly wide skull.<br><br>
                By 1986, some paleontologists proposed that all these fossils might belong to a single species, 
                Triceratops horridus. This theory was based partly on ecological reasoning—modern ecosystems usually 
                support only one or two large herbivore species in a given region. 
                Another hypothesis suggested that the differences between fossils were due to sexual 
                dimorphism and age, with certain forms representing males, females, or older individuals. 
                For example, T. hatcheri and T. obtusus were thought to be older males.<br>
                However, further analysis led researchers to reject that explanation. 
                Eventually, scientists concluded that only two species of Triceratops are valid: 
                Triceratops horridus and Triceratops prorsus. 
                Although Triceratops hatcheri had a noticeably different skull, it is not currently considered a valid species. 
                Support for the two-species model also comes from the observation that T. horridus and T. prorsus did not live at the same time, 
                strengthening the case for their distinction as separate species.

        <h3>Torosaurus theory</h3>
        <p class="pc1">
            In 2010, paleontologists John Scannella and Jack Horner proposed that Torosaurus might 
            not be a separate genus at all, but rather the fully mature adult form of Triceratops. 
            According to this theory, the differences in skull structure and frill size between the two 
            were not due to species variation but to ontogeny—the natural changes that occur as an animal grows.<br>
            The core of the hypothesis rests on skull development. 
            Triceratops juveniles and subadults had solid, short frills, but as they aged, the frill would elongate, 
            thin out, and develop large openings, resulting in what paleontologists had previously 
            identified as Torosaurus. If true, this would make Torosaurus a growth stage of Triceratops, 
            not a separate animal.<br><br>
            However, the theory is still controversial. 
            Some researchers point out that fossils of both dinosaurs appear in similar rock 
            layers and time frames, which questions the age-based progression. 
            Others argue that there are notable structural differences beyond the frill, 
            such as skull shape and horn orientation, that suggest the two are indeed distinct species. 
            Additionally, the small number of Torosaurus fossils makes it hard to confirm this growth transition with certainty.
        </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="heads">Characteristics</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most striking features of Triceratops was its enormous skull, 
            which could measure up to 2.5 meters in length, making it one of the largest of any land animal. 
            At the front of its head were three facial horns—two large ones above the eyes and a smaller one on the nose. 
            These brow horns could reach up to 1 meter in length and were likely used for defense or display.<br><br>
            The dinosaur also had a parrot-like beak and a complex dental arrangement behind it, 
            suited for chewing tough plant material. It had between 400 and 800 teeth arranged in 36 to 40 vertical 
            columns, with each column containing 3 to 5 teeth stacked on top of one another. 
            These leaf-shaped, serrated teeth curved inward and were constantly replaced throughout the dinosaur’s life, 
            which is estimated to have spanned 40 to 70 years.<br><br>
            Skin impressions show that Triceratops had a covering of large, 
            reptile-like scales, with the frill area consisting of small, polygonal scales. 
            Although direct evidence of coloration is rare, scientists believe that Triceratops may have had camouflaging skin 
            tones—possibly featuring greens, browns, and even bluish-black stripes or white markings. 
            These patterns likely helped it blend into its environment and may have played a role in 
            communication or mating displays.
        </p>
        <h3>Behaviour</h3>
        <p >
            It likely fed on a variety of low-growing vegetation, including fruits, seeds, twigs, roots, and leaves, 
            using its sharp beak to pluck plants from the ground. 
            This diet, along with its wide geographic range—from Texas to Montana—suggests it played 
            a vital role in shaping its environment and may have even contributed to plant pollination.<br><br>
            Triceratops is often imagined as a social, herding dinosaur, 
            but fossil evidence for this is limited. 
            Most Triceratops specimens have been found alone, and when discovered in groups, 
            they usually consist of no more than three individuals. 
            This has led scientists to believe that Triceratops was likely a mostly solitary animal, 
            at least for much of its life.<br><br>
            There are two major theories about the purpose of the horns and frill. 
            One proposes that they were used in combat, 
            especially against predators like T. rex. The other suggests they played a role in mating displays, 
            helping individuals attract partners or assert dominance. 
            Some researchers also believe the frill may have served a thermoregulatory function, 
            helping the animal manage body temperature. 
            In addition, these striking features likely contributed to visual communication and species 
            recognition, helping individuals identify others of their kind.

            <h2>Classification</h2>
        </div>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
            Triceratops are known to be from the genus Ceratopsidae of the family Ceratopsia, 
            a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. They are from the group Ornithischian.
            Over the years it's been debated if the Triceratops is a ceratopsid because of it's solid small frill, 
            which is similar to the Centrosaurinae, and the long horns which are more akin to Chasmosaurinae. <br>
            Some paleontologists hypothesis is that Triceratops are from the Centrosaurinae genus and not Ceratopsidae.
            But late studies show that the only similarity with Centrosaurinae and Triceratops is the small frill. <br>
            Others say Triceratops are from the genus Chasmosaurinae, which is the most acceptable theory this day.
