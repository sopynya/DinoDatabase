                    The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> is one of the most famous dinosaur.<br>
                    It was a bipedal carnivorous dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous period that lived 72 to 66 million years ago 
                    in North America. <br>
                    The Tyrannosaurus weighed between 5,000 kg and 7,000 kg. 
                    Mordern studies show that it could reach more than 13 meters in length and 3,7 to 4 meters in height. 
                    Although other dinosaurs might have exceeded their size, it's especutaled that the Tyrannosaurus had the most powerful bite. <br>

            <h3>Tyrannosaurus rex</h3>
            <p>
                The Tyrannosaurus rex, often simply called T. rex, 
                is perhaps the most famous dinosaur to have ever lived. 
                This massive, bipedal carnivore roamed western North America during the Late Cretaceous period, 
                around 66 million years ago. With an estimated length of up to 12–13 meters, 
                a height of 4 meters at the hips, and a weight of nearly 7–9 tons, 
                T. rex was one of the largest land predators in Earth's history. 
                It had incredibly powerful jaws, capable of delivering the most forceful bite known among terrestrial animals. 
                The species was first discovered in 1902 by Barnum Brown and officially named in 1905 by Henry Fairfield Osborn. 
                Its name means "tyrant lizard king"—a fitting title for a creature that dominated its ecosystem. 
                Despite its fearsome reputation, T. rex has also fascinated scientists for decades, 
                raising questions about its hunting behavior, intelligence, and even possible feathers in its early life stages.
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis</h3>
            <p class="pc1">
                Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis is a recently proposed species of tyrannosaurid that made headlines in 2024. 
                Discovered in the Hall Lake Formation of southern New Mexico, 
                the fossils were first unearthed in 1983, but only recently analyzed in detail. 
                In a study published by Nick Longrich and colleagues, T. mcraeensis was identified as a possible older cousin or ancestor of T. rex. 
                The fossils date back to around 72 million years ago, several million years before T. rex lived. 
                While similar in overall body plan to T. rex, T. mcraeensis appears to have had some distinct anatomical features, 
                leading researchers to suggest it may represent a separate species or even a transitional form. 
                Its discovery helps fill a key gap in tyrannosaur evolution and suggests that these apex predators 
                had a longer and more complex history in North America than previously thought. 
                However, some paleontologists remain cautious, noting that more fossils are needed to confirm it as a separate species.
            </p><br><br>

            <h3>Additional species</h3>
            <p class="pc1">
                In 2022, a controversial study proposed splitting the famous Tyrannosaurus rex into three separate species: 
                Tyrannosaurus imperator (“tyrant lizard emperor”), Tyrannosaurus rex (the original “king”), 
                and Tyrannosaurus regina (“tyrant lizard queen”). This idea was based on differences in the robustness of thigh bones, 
                the number of small front teeth, and their positions in the fossil record. 
                The researchers suggested that the robust-bodied T. imperator lived earlier, 
                while the more gracile T. regina appeared later.<br><br>
                However, this proposal met strong criticism from many paleontologists. 
                Experts argued that the observed differences fall within the normal range of variation for a single species and could be explained by natural diversity, 
                sexual dimorphism, or age differences rather than representing distinct species. 
                Further studies failed to find convincing evidence to support splitting T. rex.<br><br>
                Today, Tyrannosaurus imperator and Tyrannosaurus regina are not widely recognized as valid species. 
                Most scientists continue to consider all known fossils as belonging to a single species: Tyrannosaurus rex. 
                This debate highlights how complex and challenging it is to classify ancient animals based on limited fossils, 
                and it reminds us of the importance of careful analysis in paleontology.
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>Extra</h3>
            <p class="pc1">
                In 1990 an amateur paleontologist found the most complete Tyrannosaur skeleton that was about 85% complete
                and was the largest ever found. <br>
                It was found in Hell Creek and was also sold for $7.6 million, 
                making it the most expensive dinosaur skeleton until the sale of another Tyrannosaur skeleton for $31.8 million in 2020. <br>
                A study of this specimen's fossilized bones showed that it reached full size at the age 19 and died at the age of 28, 
                making it also the longest estimated life of any Tyrannosaur known.
            </p><br><br>

            <div class="border">
                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>
                It had a massive skull, up to 1.5 meters long, filled with large, sharp teeth designed for crushing and tearing flesh. 
                Its strong jaws delivered one of the most powerful bites of any land animal.<br><br>
                Despite its enormous size, T. rex had relatively short but muscular arms with only two clawed fingers. These arms were likely used for gripping prey. 
                Its powerful hind legs were built to support its heavy body and allowed it to move quickly, while its long, 
                muscular tail helped balance its large head and torso.<br><br>
                Tyrannosaurus rex had forward-facing eyes positioned on the front of its skull, 
                which allowed for binocular vision—meaning its left and right eyes’ fields of view overlapped. 
                This overlap gave T. rex excellent depth perception, crucial for judging distances accurately.<br><br>
                Not every adult Tyrannosaur was as big as 12 meters and both their sizes and weight variated between each specimen. <br> <br>
                The Tyrannosaurus were once thought to have feathers and fur, 
                but, after a fossil of their skin was found, scientists concluded that they did not have feathers nor fur. 
                They were covered in very small scales. <br>
            </p><br><br>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p class="pc1">
                Tyrannosaurus rex lived across a wide range in Late Cretaceous North America, 
                inhabiting diverse ecosystems from coastal plains to semi-arid regions. 
                It likely originated from Asian tyrannosaurs before migrating to North America.<br><br>
                With an estimated adult population around 20,000 individuals at any given time, T. rex had a relatively low fossilization rate, 
                meaning only a tiny fraction of individuals are preserved as fossils. 
                Their populations could vary widely depending on the size of the habitat.<br><br>
                Behaviorally, T. rex had highly developed senses, including excellent low-frequency hearing and a strong sense of smell, 
                useful for tracking prey over long distances. 
                It had the most powerful bite of any land animal, capable of crushing bones to consume large carcasses fully.<br><br>
                Most paleontologists agree that T. rex was both an active predator and a scavenger. 
                While earlier ideas suggested pack hunting, it is now thought T. rex probably hunted alone, like most predators. 
                Evidence also indicates occasional cannibalism, seen through tooth marks on other T. rex fossils.<br><br>
                There is no direct proof of parental care, but T. rex may have protected and fed its young. 
                Some skull injuries once attributed to parasites are now believed to result from combat with others.<br><br>
                Despite its massive size and bulk, T. rex could run at speeds up to around 32 km/h (20 mph) but was slower than some other large theropods. 
                When sitting down, it likely balanced its weight on its pelvis and could probably get up if it fell.

                <h2>Classification</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Tyrannosaurus classification</h3>
            <p>
                The Tyrannosaurus are from the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, the family Tyrannosauridae, and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. <br>
                They are theropods coelurosaurs and from the Saurischia group. <br>
                The earliest tyrannosaur group were the crested proceratosaurids, while later and more derived members belong to the Pantyrannosauria. 
                Tyrannosaurs started out as small theropods, however, at least some became larger by the Early Cretaceous.<br> <br>
                Tyrannosauroids are characterized by their fused nasals and dental arrangement. 
                Pantyrannosaurs are characterized by unique features in their hips as well as an enlarged foramen in the quadrate, 
                a broad postorbital (the back of the eye sockets), and hourglass shaped nasals. <br>
                Tyrannosaurids lack special crests on their nasal bones, and have a lacrimal with a distinctive process on it.
