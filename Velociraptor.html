            <h1>Velociraptor</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Velociraptor</i> is a genus of carnivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Late Cretaceous epoch in Asia (71-75 million years ago). There are currently 2 recognized species. 
                <br> They are 0,5 m tall, and 1,5-2 m long. They weight about 14-20 kg and they are biped, feathered, have short arms, a long tail, serrated teeths and a big, curved, sickle-shaped claw on the second toe of each foot. 
                <br> The first Velociraptor fossil was discovered on 11 August 1923 by Peter Kaisen who then named it Velociraptor mongoliensis because it was found in Mongolia. It was a crushed, but completed skull and a toe claw. 
                <br>The name Velociraptor is derived from the Latin words velox ('swift') and raptor ('robber' or 'plunderer').

        <h3>Velociraptor mongoliensis</h3>
        <p>
            Velociraptor mongoliensis is the most famous and best-understood species of Velociraptor. 
            It was first discovered in 1923 during an American Museum of Natural History expedition to the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, 
            led by Roy Chapman Andrews. The species was officially described in 1924 by paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn.<br>
            One of the most famous fossils ever discovered is the "Fighting Dinosaurs" specimen, 
            which shows a Velociraptor mongoliensis locked in combat with a Protoceratops — 
            a rare and direct snapshot of predatory behavior in the fossil record. 
            This find confirmed its active predatory nature.
        </p>
        <h3>Velociraptor osmolskae</h3>
        <p>
            Velociraptor osmolskae is a lesser-known species of Velociraptor that was named in 2008, 
            based on fossils found in Inner Mongolia, China. 
            It was named in honor of the Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska, 
            who contributed greatly to the study of Asian dinosaurs.<br>
            This species lived around the same time as V. mongoliensis and shared many similar features, 
            such as body size, shape, and likely also feathers. 
            However, V. osmolskae is known mainly from a partial upper jaw (maxilla), 
            which shows slight anatomical differences from V. mongoliensis. 
            These differences were enough for paleontologists to recognize it as a distinct species.<br>
            Because of the limited fossil material, much less is known about its specific behavior, 
            but it likely had similar hunting and ecological habits to V. mongoliensis. 
            Its discovery helps support the idea that multiple closely related dromaeosaur species lived across different regions of ancient Asia during the Late Cretaceous.

            <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Velociraptor body and behaviour</h3>
        <p>
            Velociraptor was a small, agile, and feathered dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, 
            around 75 to 71 million years ago in what is now Asia. 
            It was about two meters long, relatively lightweight, and built for speed and precision. 
            Its body featured a long, stiff tail that helped with balance, and its limbs were likely covered in feathers, 
            suggesting a close evolutionary relationship with birds. 
            A distinctive feature of Velociraptor was the large, curved claw on each foot, 
            which it probably used to grasp or pin down prey.<br><br>
            Although complete fossils are rare, Velociraptor is thought to have been a fast and intelligent predator. 
            Its forward-facing eyes provided decent depth perception, and its brain size suggests it had sharp sensory awareness. 
            Velociraptor likely hunted smaller animals and may have scavenged when the opportunity arose. 
            While the idea of pack hunting has been debated, there is no strong evidence to confirm it. 
            Overall, Velociraptor was a smart, quick, and effective hunter adapted to a variety of Cretaceous environments across ancient Asia. <br><br>
            Velociraptor lived in a dry, desert-like environment with sand dunes, sparse vegetation, and occasional river channels. 
            Fossils have been found in areas that were once arid or semi-arid, 
            such as the Gobi Desert region of modern-day Mongolia and China. 
            These habitats were harsh, with extreme temperatures, limited water sources, 
            and shifting sands, creating a challenging landscape for both predators and prey.

            <h2>Classification</h2>
        </div>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
            Velociraptors are from the Eudromaeosauria group, a derived sub-group of the larger family Dromaeosauridae theropod dinosaurs. 
            They are from the Saurischia group.<br>
            Eudromaeosaurs were all bipedal and had relatively long arms in comparison to other theropods.
            Their second toe possessed the archetypal sickle-claw that all known dromaeosaurids bore which was held off the ground so that only the third and fourth toes touched the ground when walking. 
            Eudromaeosaurs also generally possessed long and stiff tails, which are believed to have been used for balance.
            There is some direct evidence of eudromaeosaurs such as Velociraptor being feathered. 
            Today, it is believed that all eudromaeosaurs were fully-feathered and possessed wings. <br>
            Velociraptors are also from the velociraptonae sub-group, derived from the dromaeosaurid dinosaurs.
            This group was thought to only have Velociraptor as its member, but analyses concluded that a few other dinosaurs were also part of this group, 
            including: Tsaagan, Linheraptor, and potentially Saurornitholestes and Deinonychus.
            The velociraptonae were known for their relatively small size, agile nature, and evidence of feathers.
