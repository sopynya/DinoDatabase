                    Ankylosaurus is estimated to have been between 6 and 8 meters long, between 1-2 meters in height and weighted 4,000 to 8,000 kg. <br>

                <h2>Discovery</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Ankylosaurus magniventris</h3>
            <p>
                In 1906, the first remains of Ankylosaurus magniventris were unearthed in the Hell Creek Formation, 
                near Gilbert Creek, Montana. The discovery included fragments of the upper skull, 
                two teeth, parts of the shoulder, sections of vertebrae, ribs, and more than 30 bony armor plates. 
                These fossilized remains formed the basis for identifying Ankylosaurus magniventris — 
                the only recognized species of the genus.<br>
                To this day, no complete Ankylosaurus skeleton has ever been discovered. 
                Most findings consist of isolated bones, armor fragments, and teeth. 
                With only around six significant specimens uncovered, scientists still face challenges in fully understanding 
                this armored dinosaur’s anatomy and whether other species may have existed. 
                Despite these gaps, the discoveries made over the last century have cemented Ankylosaurus as one of 
                the most iconic armored dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous.
            </p><br><br>
            <div class="border">
                <h2>Characteristics</h2>
            </div>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>
                The body of Ankylosaurus magniventris was a formidable display of natural armor and defensive adaptations. 
                Its skull, broad and triangular in shape, was wider than it was long — the largest known specimen 
                measuring 64.5 cm in length and 74.5 cm in width. The smallest skull measured 55.5 cm long and 64.5 cm wide. 
                Covering the surface of the skull was a scale-like ornamentation known as caputegulae, 
                formed by remodeling of the skull bones themselves. 
                Although three Ankylosaurus skulls have been discovered, they show subtle differences, 
                likely due to fossilization processes and individual variation.<br>
                The dinosaur's eyes sat in nearly round sockets that faced slightly forward, 
                as the skull tapered toward the front. Above the eyes, 
                bony crests merged with pyramid-shaped horns that projected backward from the sides of the skull. 
                These crests and horns may have originally been separate structures. 
                The braincase was short and robust, while the nostrils were positioned so they could not be seen from the front 
                — a result of expanded sinuses in the upper jaw bones.
                It possessed between 70 and 71 small, leaf-shaped, serrated teeth, suitable for browsing vegetation close to the ground.<br><br>
                Ankylosaurus was a quadruped, with stout legs and low-slung limbs that supported its heavily armored body. 
                Its most distinctive feature was its protective armor, composed of bony plates called osteoderms embedded 
                in the skin. Though their exact arrangement remains uncertain, many scientists believe the armor primarily 
                covered the back and sides for defense. These osteoderms varied greatly in size — from as small as 1 cm 
                to as large as 35.5 cm — and were typically flat, thin-walled, and hollow on the underside.<br>
                At the end of its tail, Ankylosaurus bore a massive bony club made of fused osteoderms. 
                This tail club measured approximately 60 cm long, 50 cm wide, and 20 cm tall, shaped like a large 
                ball with a row of smaller osteoderms running along the tail’s midline.
            </p>
            <h3>Behaviour</h3>
            <p>
                Ankylosaurus magniventris is believed to have been a generally slow-moving dinosaur, 
                though it likely could make quick defensive movements when threatened.<br>
                Defensively, Ankylosaurus was exceptionally well protected. 
                Its body was covered in lightweight, yet durable, armor scales (osteoderms) designed 
                to resist damage from predators. Its most formidable weapon was its tail club — a massive, 
                bony structure at the end of its tail — capable of delivering powerful blows strong enough 
                to break bones, making it an effective deterrent against attackers.<br><br>
                This dinosaur was adapted for non-selective low browsing, 
                likely feeding on abundant ferns and low-growing shrubs. 
                While it may have avoided tough, woody plants, it probably consumed a variety of tougher 
                leaves and possibly pulpy fruits. Estimates suggest that Ankylosaurus could have eaten up 
                to 60 kilograms of plant material per day — similar to the daily intake of a modern elephant. 
                It’s also thought that Ankylosaurus only partially chewed its food, 
                relying on its broad ribcage to aid in digesting large amounts of unchewed plant matter.<br><br>
                Interestingly, the position of its nostrils suggests it might have engaged in earth-moving behaviors, 
                possibly rooting for plants, tubers, or even small prey. This, along with its slow tooth replacement 
                rate compared to other ornithischians, has led to speculation that Ankylosaurus could have been omnivorous.<br>
                esearch has also shown that the complex sinuses and nasal passages within its skull might have served multiple purposes 
                — reducing skull weight, regulating heat and moisture, and perhaps even producing low-frequency sounds. 
                The structure of its inner ear suggests it was capable of hearing such low tones.<br><br>
                Fossils of Ankylosaurus have been found in formations such as Hell Creek, Lance, 
                and Ferris in Wyoming, the Scollard Formation in Alberta, and the Frenchman Formation in Saskatchewan 
                — regions that had warm subtropical or temperate climates during the Late Cretaceous period. 
                However, its fossils are relatively rare in these areas, 
                leading scientists to suggest that Ankylosaurus may have lived in upland environments where 
                fossilization was less common, rather than in coastal lowlands.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
                Ankylosaurus are so distinct from other known dinosaurs that a new family had to be made just for them, 
                the Ankylosauridae, typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. <br>
                In 1923 paleontologists created the name Ankylosauria, thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder. <br>
                The Ankylosauria is in the clade Thyreophora. <br>
                Ankylosaurus is considered part of the subfamily Ankylosaurinae (members of which are called ankylosaurines) within Ankylosauridae.
                Ankylosaurus are Ornithischia.
